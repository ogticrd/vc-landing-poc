        "q": "Can my users use their credentials without internet access?",
        "a": "Yes, your users can present their verifiable credentials without internet connection. The cryptographic verification of credentials works offline. However, to verify the current status (if it's revoked or suspended) requires connection to query your institution."

      {
        "q": "What types of documents can my institution issue as verifiable credentials?",

        "q": "Is verification fully decentralized?",
